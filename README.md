# Quiz-Generator

A stand-alone application - using Oxford Dictionaries API and a database back-end - which will allow teachers to create quizzes for their students. They will be able to create quizzes by giving them the option to either add the key terms and definitions or only the key terms (which will find the definitions online). These key terms and definitions will then be exported into an excel document which can be uploaded onto the Kahoot or Socrative website.
